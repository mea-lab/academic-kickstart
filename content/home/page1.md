<font size="+3">**Welcome to the MEA Lab**</font></br><br/>
We are the **Movement Estimation and Analysis Laboratory** within the Biomedical Engineering program at Florida Tech. Our vision is to develop new technology to facilitate the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of 
neurolgical diseases such as stroke and Parkinson's disease. The Lab conducts multidisciplinary research in areas such as

* Computational Neuroscience
* Biomechanics
* Machine Learning
* Computer Vision
* Signals and Systems Processing 
* Systems Identification


We welcome talented and motivated graduate students to join our lab through the Florida Tech's <a href="https://www.fit.edu/programs/biomedical-engineering-ms/">master</a> and <a href="https://www.fit.edu/programs/biomedical-engineering-phd/">Ph.D.</a> programs in Biomedical Engineering.
