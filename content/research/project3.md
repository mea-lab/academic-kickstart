### **Computer-vision based diagnosis of neurological diseases**

The way we move our face call say a lot about our overall health. Our research 
shows orofacial movements of patients with neurological, such as Parkinson's disease,
Alzaihmer's diseaea, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, 
are significantly different from those of age-matched healthy controls. 
Thus, analysis of orofacial movements can be used as a tool for diagnosis, 
assessments, and monitoring of treatment effectiveneess in multiple clinical populations.  

However, if is difficult to track how the face moves. Typically, especialed and expensive 
equipment, such as motion capture systems, are required to analyze the movements of the face. 
Thus, this type of analysis is only performed in laboratory and research settings. 

The main objective of this project is to apply and improve recent development on facial analysis based on 
**convolutional neural networks** to develop a clinically valid tool for analysis of orofacial movements. Our lab
will develop and validate an open-source, easy-to-use app that patients can use to objectivelly evaluate their disease
status, and clinicias can use to monitor the effect of treatment from the patient's home using a computer or mobile device.
